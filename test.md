# Test Some Note Taking

I am testing out taking notes in markdown. This is how it would look.

```python
def test(something):
		a = dir(something)
		return a
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
	<title></title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
```
